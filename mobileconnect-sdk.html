    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      If you are not familiar with Gallagher's Mobile Connect application, or how it and the mobile credential registration process work, you should familiarize yourself before going further with the SDK. <br />
      A good place to start is with the Cloud and App Security Technical Information Paper.

    </p>

    <p>
      Once you are familiar with Mobile Connect and the Credential Registration process, we recommend that you start with the Integration Guide. <br />
      It is designed to give a big picture view covering server-side integration as well as the mobile apps, and offers architectural guidance.

    <h2>How to get the SDK software</h2>

    <p>
      Please contact our Security Interfaces inbox at <a href="mailto:interfaces@security.gallagher.com">interfaces@security.gallagher.com</a> <br />
      You will be asked to fill out our Interfaces Developer Application form. <br />
      We need this information to ensure we can provide you with the right software, and so we can add your details to our distribution list to notify you about future updates and security fixes.

    <h2>Command Centre integration</h2>
    <p>
      In order to issue Mobile Credentials to your application using the SDK, you must use the Command Centre REST api.
    </p>
    <p>The "Getting Started with the Command Centre REST API" and "Running the REST API sample integrations" documents will guide you through getting this up and running.</p>
    <p>

    <h3>Sample Code</h3>
    <p>We provide a server-side sample integration which uses the REST api to create cardholders and issue Mobile Credentials for them.
      The sample integration is available for NodeJS and ASP.NET Core.
