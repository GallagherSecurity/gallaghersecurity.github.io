# Mobile Connect SDK 17.2 Release Notes

This release includes documentation enhancements, minor bug fixes, and platform-specific improvements across both iOS and Android SDKs.

## iOS SDK Changes

* Improved Wallet feature documentation in the Developer Guide:
    * Clarified the process for requesting the Wallet app entitlement.
    * Included recommendations and considerations for displaying and hiding the "Add to Apple Wallet" button.
* Introduced a new helper function `addToWalletStatus` in the `Wallet` class, replacing the now-deprecated `canAddToWallet`.
* Calling `startProvisioningWallet` is now blocked if a pass provisioning process is already underway. This prevents initiating new requests while Apple completes the existing provisioning asynchronously. This is indicated by the new enum case: `WalletProvisioningError.provisioningInProgress`.


## Android SDK Changes

* Support for Android 15 (API 35) is now available.
* Migrates from the deprecated `FingerprintManager` to `BiometricPrompt`. This means any Biometric authentication method which meets the Class 3/Strong rating can be used as a second factor for Gallagher credentials. Refer to the Developer Guide for more details.
* Replaced the external RxJava dependency with an internal module to fully isolate it from consuming apps. This avoids version conflicts and ensures seamless SDK integration regardless of the appâ€™s RxJava version.
* Minor enhancements and bugfixes within the FIDO module.
